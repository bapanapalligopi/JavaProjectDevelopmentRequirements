**SAST** stands for **Static Application Security Testing**.

### üîç What Is SAST?

SAST is a **white-box testing** method used to find **security vulnerabilities** in your application **source code**, **bytecode**, or **binary code** ‚Äî **without executing the program**.

---

### üß† How It Works

* Scans the code *statically* (i.e., while it's at rest).
* Looks for patterns that indicate common security flaws (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, insecure cryptography).
* Typically integrated into CI/CD pipelines or development environments.
* Often runs early in the development lifecycle (shift-left security).

| When Used | Early in development        | During/after deployment |
| Access    | Source code access required | No source code needed   |
| Detects   | Code-level vulnerabilities  | Runtime vulnerabilities |

### üìå Summary

SAST is essential for **secure development** practices because it:

* Helps **developers** catch issues early.
* Reduces **cost of fixes** by addressing bugs before release.
* Integrates well into **DevSecOps** workflows.

Let me know if you want help picking a SAST tool or integrating one into your workflow.
Absolutely! Let‚Äôs go deeper into **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** ‚Äî including **architecture, workflow, benefits, limitations**, and **best practices**.

## üîß **SAST Architecture & Workflow**

SAST tools typically follow this process:

### 1. **Code Ingestion**

* Accepts source code, bytecode, or binaries.
* Supports multiple languages and frameworks.
* Can be run locally, in CI/CD, or in cloud/on-prem servers.

### 2. **Parsing & Semantic Analysis**

* Parses code into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
* Understands **control flow**, **data flow**, and **function calls**.
* Performs **taint analysis**: tracks untrusted input from source to sink.

### 3. **Pattern Matching & Rules Evaluation**

* Applies **predefined** or **custom rules**.
* Identifies:

  * Insecure coding patterns (e.g., use of `eval`, `exec`, etc.)
  * Missing validations
  * API misuse
  * Cryptographic misconfigurations

### 4. **Reporting**

* Generates detailed reports:

  * Vulnerability type
  * CWE ID (Common Weakness Enumeration)
  * Severity (low/medium/high/critical)
  * Location in code
  * Suggested remediation

## üß± SAST Integration in DevSecOps

### Where SAST fits:

```
Code ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
        ‚Üë
     [SAST]
```

* Run as part of:

  * Developer IDEs (e.g., with SonarLint, Semgrep plugins)
  * Git pre-commit hooks
  * CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ **Shift-left Security** | Detect vulnerabilities early in the SDLC (cheap to fix)                  |
| ‚úÖ **Automated Scans**     | Integrates into your CI/CD for consistent testing                        |
| ‚úÖ **No Runtime Needed**   | Works on inactive code ‚Äî faster and safer                                |
| ‚úÖ **Compliance Support**  | Helps meet standards like **OWASP Top 10**, **PCI-DSS**, **HIPAA**, etc. |

## üö´ Limitations of SAST

| Limitation                 | Description                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå **False Positives**      | May flag non-issues due to over-cautious rules                  |
| ‚ùå **Code Coverage**        | Doesn‚Äôt analyze code paths that are dynamically generated       |
| ‚ùå **No Runtime Context**   | Can‚Äôt detect runtime issues like server misconfig or auth flaws |
| ‚ùå **Performance Overhead** | Scans can slow down builds in large codebases                   |

## üß† Best Practices for SAST

1. **Run Early and Often** ‚Äì Integrate into the dev workflow, not just the release phase.
2. **Use Incremental Scans** ‚Äì Scan only changed code for faster results in CI/CD.
3. **Triage Findings** ‚Äì Prioritize high-risk issues and suppress false positives.
4. **Train Developers** ‚Äì Teach devs to read and act on scan reports.
5. **Pair with DAST & SCA** ‚Äì SAST alone isn‚Äôt enough; combine with:

   * DAST (Dynamic testing)
   * SCA (Software Composition Analysis for open-source libraries)
