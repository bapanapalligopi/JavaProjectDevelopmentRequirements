Great news — from the logs you've posted, SonarQube is now **starting correctly**. Here's a breakdown of what the messages indicate:

---

### ✅ **What’s Going Right**

1. **Temp Directory Initialized**:

   ```
   Cleaning or creating temp directory B:\sonarqube-25.6.0.109173\temp
   ```

2. **Elasticsearch Started**:

   ```
   Elasticsearch listening on [HTTP: 127.0.0.1:9001, TCP: 127.0.0.1:{}]
   Process[es] is up
   ```

3. **Web Server Launching**:

   ```
   Launch process[WEB_SERVER] ...
   ```

This means the **SonarQube backend components (Elasticsearch and Web Server)** have been successfully started.

### ⚠️ **Minor Warning**

You see:

```
Standard Commons Logging discovery in action with spring-jcl: please remove commons-logging.jar from classpath in order to avoid potential conflicts
```

This is just a warning from Spring — it’s not critical. You can safely ignore it **unless** you run into classpath issues later.

If you want to eliminate the warning:

* Check if `commons-logging.jar` exists in `lib\` or any other classpath directory.
* Remove it, **only if it's not required by a plugin**.

### ✅ Next Step: Open SonarQube in Browser

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:9000
```

You should see the SonarQube UI. The default credentials are:

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `admin`

Let me know if the page doesn't load or if you see any other issues in the browser or command prompt.
